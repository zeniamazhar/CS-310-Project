# Moveasy

Moveasy is an Android app to follow movies in three lists: Favorites, Watched and Watch Later. In order to run the app on Android Studio, follow these steps:

- Open a directory for the project and run `git clone https://github.com/zeniamazhar/CS-310-Project` in the terminal.
- Open the cloned project in Android Studio.
- Use the `flutter pub get` command in the terminal to get dependencies.
- Ensure that Dart support is enabled with the correct Dart SDK pathway for the project. This can be enabled by the corresponding suggestion that appears on top when the `lib/main.dart` file is opened in Android Studio.
- Connect an emulator and click on the yellow arrow on top of the screen to launch the app.
